Free, open-source Chinese character data

## Install
To get started, you would have to install both Meteor and the mongodump/mongorestore tools, open up the console, and type "Meteor.call('restore');", which will reload the database from the backup in the repository.

## Usage
1.Open http://localhost:3000/#{chinese} in browser, [like this](http://localhost:3000/#çš„).

2.The "A" and "D" keys step back and forth between characters, while "shift-A" and "shift-D" step back and forth between incomplete characters. You can use the URL bar directly to add a new character (type it after the hash mark).

3.The "W" and "S" keys step up and down between different "stages". I organized the data generation workflow into a series of heuristic / ML algorithms, each of does one analysis and which can be overridden manually. Using the tool effectively requires knowing how these algorithms work and fail, though, since if you know one stage is probably going to be right, you can quickly scan it and move on.

4.Export data.
``  
Meteor.call('export');
// Check the Meteor logs and wait for dictionary.txt and graphics.txt to be ready
Meteor.call('exportSVGs');
// Check the Meteor logs and wait for .svgs to be ready
``
